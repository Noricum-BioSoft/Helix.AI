## Usage

### Basic Vendor Research

```bash
# Command: "I want to order these sequences from a DNA synthesis vendor"
```

This command will:
1. Analyze your sequence requirements (length, quantity)
2. Search the vendor database for matches
3. Display vendor comparisons with pricing
4. Provide AI-powered recommendations

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Specify requirements
"I need to order 1000bp sequences in large quantities from a DNA synthesis vendor"

# Research specific services
"Find vendors that offer CRISPR gRNA synthesis for my sequences"

# Compare vendors
"Compare pricing between Twist Bioscience and GenScript for my gene synthesis"
```

## Vendor Selection Criteria

### Sequence Requirements
- **Length**: Short oligos (<200bp) vs long genes (>5kb)
- **Quantity**: Small orders vs large-scale synthesis
- **Complexity**: Simple sequences vs complex constructs

  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Vendor Selection
1. **Request Multiple Quotes**: Always get quotes from 3-5 vendors
2. **Compare Total Costs**: Include shipping, validation, and additional services
3. **Check Turnaround Times**: Ensure delivery meets project timeline
4. **Verify Quality Standards**: Confirm QC procedures meet your requirements

### Cost Optimization
1. **Bulk Orders**: Combine multiple sequences for volume discounts
2. **Standard Delivery**: Use standard delivery unless rush is critical
3. **Service Bundling**: Order synthesis + cloning + sequencing together
4. **Vendor Relationships**: Build relationships for better pricing

### Quality Assurance
1. **Sequence Validation**: Always verify synthesized sequences
2. **QC Reports**: Request quality control documentation
3. **Backup Plans**: Have alternative vendors for critical projects
4. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all orders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Vendor Matches**: Check sequence length and complexity requirements
2. **High Pricing**: Consider bulk orders or alternative vendors
3. **Long Turnaround**: Plan ahead or use rush services
4. **Quality Issues**: Request additional QC or use high-fidelity vendors
