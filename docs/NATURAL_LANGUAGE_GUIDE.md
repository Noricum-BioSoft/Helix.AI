- "Show me the alignment of these sequences"

### Sequence Mutation
- "Mutate this sequence"
- "Generate variants of this DNA"
- "Create mutations of the sequence"
- "Show me different versions of this sequence"
- "Generate 50 variants of this sequence"

### Data Analysis
- "Analyze this sequence data"
- "Show me statistics for these sequences"
- "Create visualizations of the data"

## Command Examples

### Example 1: Basic Vendor Research
**User:** "I want to order the sequences from a DNA synthesis vendor"
**System Response:** 
- Lists major DNA synthesis vendors (Twist Bioscience, GenScript, IDT, Eurofins, etc.)
- Shows pricing ranges, turnaround times, and specialties
- Provides recommendations based on sequence length and quantity

### Example 2: Testing Research
**User:** "What testing options are available for my sequences?"
**System Response:**
- Lists quality control testing options (Sanger sequencing, HPLC, mass spec)
- Shows validation assays (functional testing, expression analysis)
- Provides stability testing options
- Includes vendor recommendations for testing services

### Example 3: Vendor Comparison
**User:** "Compare Twist Bioscience and GenScript"
**System Response:**
- Detailed comparison of services, pricing, and turnaround times
- Strengths and limitations of each vendor
- Contact information and ordering details
- Recommendations for different use cases

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific:** Mention sequence length, quantity, or specific requirements
2. **Use Natural Language:** Don't worry about technical terms - the system understands context
3. **Ask Follow-up Questions:** Request more details about specific vendors or services
4. **Combine Commands:** You can ask for analysis and then vendor research in one conversation

## Available Tools

The system has access to these tools:
- **Sequence Alignment:** Multiple sequence alignment with various algorithms
- **Sequence Mutation:** Generate variants and mutations of sequences
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis and visualization of sequence data
- **DNA Vendor Research:** Research synthesis vendors and testing options
- **Visualization:** Create plots and visual representations of data

All tools work together seamlessly, so you can analyze sequences and then immediately research synthesis options for experimental validation.
