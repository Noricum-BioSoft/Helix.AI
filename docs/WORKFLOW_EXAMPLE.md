# Complete Bioinformatics Workflow Example

This document demonstrates the complete workflow from FASTA file upload to DNA synthesis submission.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Upload FASTA File
**User Action:** Drag and drop a FASTA file containing multiple sequences
**Command:** "align these sequences"
**Expected Output:** Phylogenetic tree visualization

### 2. Sequence Selection
**User Action:** Type natural language command
**Command:** "pick 1 sequence randomly from the alignment"
**Expected Output:** Textual representation of selected sequence with explanation

### 3. Sequence Mutation
**User Action:** Type natural language command
**Command:** "mutate the selected sequence to generate 96 variants"
**Expected Output:** Visual representation of sequence alignment

### 4. Vector Expression
**User Action:** Type natural language command
**Command:** "express all mutants in pTet vector"
**Expected Output:** Plasmid/vector map visualization

### 5. Synthesis Submission
**User Action:** Type natural language command
**Command:** "submit these sequences for synthesis"
**Expected Output:** DNA synthesis quote and vendor recommendations

## Example Commands

```bash
# Step 1: Align sequences
"align the uploaded sequences"

# Step 2: Select sequence
"pick 1 sequence randomly from the alignment"
"select the sequence with highest conservation score"

# Step 3: Generate variants
"mutate the selected sequence to generate 96 variants"
"create 96 variants from the sequence"

# Step 4: Vector expression
"express all mutants in pTet vector"
"create plasmid visualization for the variants"

# Step 5: Synthesis submission
"submit these sequences for synthesis"
"get a quote for DNA synthesis"
```

## Natural Language Flexibility

The system supports various ways to express the same intent:

- **Alignment:** "align sequences", "perform alignment", "sequence alignment"
- **Selection:** "pick", "select", "choose", "randomly pick", "select best"
- **Mutation:** "mutate", "generate variants", "create variants", "96 variants"
- **Vector:** "express in vector", "plasmid visualization", "pTet vector"
- **Synthesis:** "submit for synthesis", "order sequences", "get quote"

## Expected Outputs

1. **Phylogenetic Tree:** Interactive tree visualization showing evolutionary relationships
2. **Sequence Selection:** Detailed text with sequence info and selection rationale
3. **Mutation Visualization:** Plot showing mutation distribution and statistics
4. **Plasmid Map:** Circular plasmid visualization with features
5. **Synthesis Quote:** Pricing breakdown and vendor recommendations
