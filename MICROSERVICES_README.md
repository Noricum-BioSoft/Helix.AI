# Helix.AI Architecture - Deployment Options

## 🎯 **Primary Architecture: Unified System**

Helix.AI is designed as a **unified monolithic system** for optimal development, deployment, and open-source adoption.

### **Why Unified Architecture**

1. **Simpler Development**: Single codebase, easier debugging
2. **Better Performance**: No network overhead between components
3. **Lower Complexity**: Reduced operational overhead
4. **Open Source Friendly**: Easier for contributors to understand
5. **Faster Startup**: No container orchestration required

### **Unified System Components**

```

├── start.sh                    # Single startup command
├── frontend/                   # React frontend
├── backend/
│   ├── main_with_mcp.py       # Enhanced MCP backend
│   ├── history_manager.py     # Session management

```

## 🚀 **Getting Started (Recommended)**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Helix.AI.git
cd Helix.AI

# Start the unified system
./start.sh
```

- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8001/docs

## ☁️ **Future: Cloud Deployment with Microservices**

For production cloud deployments with high scalability requirements, Helix.AI can be deployed using a microservices architecture.

### **When to Consider Microservices**

- **High Traffic**: 1000+ concurrent users
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Need to scale individual components
- **Team Size**: Multiple development teams
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or similar
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Distributed tracing and metrics

### **Microservices Architecture (Future)**

```
Helix.AI (Cloud Microservices)
├── API Gateway              # Single entry point
├── Workflow Engine          # Orchestration service
├── Bioinformatics Services  # Individual tool services
│   ├── Alignment Service
│   ├── Mutation Service
│   ├── Phylogenetic Service
│   └── Plasmid Service
├── Infrastructure
│   ├── Redis (caching)
│   ├── PostgreSQL (data)
│   └── MinIO (file storage)
└── Frontend                 # React application
```

### **Microservices Benefits for Cloud**

1. **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on demand
2. **Technology Diversity**: Use different languages/frameworks per service
3. **Team Autonomy**: Independent development and deployment
4. **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't affect entire system
5. **Advanced Monitoring**: Service-level metrics and tracing

### **Microservices Trade-offs**

| Aspect | Unified | Microservices |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Performance** | High | Medium |
| **Scalability** | Vertical | Horizontal |
| **Development** | Simple | Complex |
| **Deployment** | Easy | Complex |
| **Resource Usage** | Low | High |

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

### **For Most Use Cases: Unified Architecture**
- ✅ **Development**: Faster iteration and debugging
- ✅ **Testing**: Easier to test and validate
- ✅ **Deployment**: Simple single-command startup
- ✅ **Open Source**: Lower barrier to contribution
- ✅ **Performance**: Better resource utilization

### **For Cloud Production: Microservices (Future)**
- 🔄 **High Scalability**: When user base grows significantly
- 🔄 **Team Scaling**: When multiple teams work on different components
- 🔄 **Advanced Monitoring**: When detailed service-level metrics are needed
- 🔄 **Cloud Infrastructure**: When deploying to Kubernetes or similar

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Metric | Unified | Microservices |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Startup Time | 10-15 seconds | 30-60 seconds |
| Memory Usage | 500MB-1GB | 2-4GB |
| Development Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Deployment Complexity | Low | High |
| Debugging | Simple | Complex |

## 🔮 **Migration Path**

### **From Unified to Microservices**
When the need arises, the unified system can be decomposed:

1. **Extract Services**: Split backend into individual services
2. **Add Infrastructure**: Redis, PostgreSQL, MinIO
3. **Implement Gateway**: API Gateway for routing
4. **Containerize**: Docker containers for each service
5. **Orchestrate**: Kubernetes or similar for deployment

### **Gradual Migration**
- Start with unified architecture
- Monitor performance and scaling needs
- Extract services incrementally as needed
- Maintain backward compatibility
